# NODE-JS-Works
# REST API Examples with Node.js and Express

This repository contains two examples of REST APIs implemented using Node.js and Express. These examples demonstrate the basic functionality of creating, reading, and handling data, with one using a local JSON file and the other connecting to MongoDB.

## Features


1. **Example 1: REST API with Local JSON Storage**

2. **Example 2: REST API with MongoDB**
   - A REST API connected to a MongoDB database.
   - Routes are organized into modules for scalability.
   - Demonstrates middleware and database connection handling.
